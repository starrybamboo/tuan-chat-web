# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves refactoring the character list sidebar component to remove the Virtuoso virtual scrolling library and implement native infinite scrolling using React Query's InfiniteQuery functionality. The goal is to simplify the implementation while maintaining the same user experience for browsing and managing character roles.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to scroll through my character list without virtual scrolling dependencies, so that the application has fewer external dependencies and simpler code maintenance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user scrolls to the bottom of the character list THEN the system SHALL automatically load the next page of characters
2. WHEN characters are being loaded THEN the system SHALL display a loading spinner at the bottom of the list
3. WHEN there are no more characters to load THEN the system SHALL not attempt to fetch additional pages
4. WHEN the user searches for characters THEN the filtered results SHALL display without virtual scrolling

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the character list to maintain all existing functionality, so that I can continue to select, delete, and manage characters as before.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks on a character THEN the system SHALL select that character and close the drawer
2. WHEN the user enters selection mode THEN the system SHALL allow multiple character selection
3. WHEN the user deletes characters THEN the system SHALL remove them from the list and update the backend
4. WHEN the user creates a new character THEN the system SHALL add it to the top of the list

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the character list to perform well with large datasets, so that scrolling remains smooth even with many characters.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user scrolls through the list THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth scrolling performance
2. WHEN new characters are loaded THEN the system SHALL append them to the existing list without flickering
3. WHEN the component unmounts THEN the system SHALL properly clean up event listeners and prevent memory leaks
4. WHEN the user searches THEN the system SHALL filter the local character data without additional API calls

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the code to be maintainable and follow React best practices, so that future modifications are easier to implement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the scroll detection THEN the system SHALL use proper event listener cleanup
2. WHEN managing state THEN the system SHALL avoid unnecessary re-renders
3. WHEN handling async operations THEN the system SHALL properly handle loading and error states
4. WHEN the component re-renders THEN the system SHALL maintain scroll position appropriately
